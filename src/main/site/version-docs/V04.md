# Branch: V04
# Goals: 
* Add a JQuery call from our static page to the API
* Add a new feature to our API and deploy it
* Tweak our local development process

## Introduction to V04
You now have a functioning website with both dynamic and static content being served through Cloudfront.  We have the
basic plumbing done and its time to start adding features.  First, we are going to add some Javascript to make sure
the server works correctly.  Then we'll add another feature to the API (a chirp count) and work through how 
we deploy new versions of the API.  Finally, we'll tweak our development process works the way we would like.
