# Branch: V04
# Goals: 
* Add a JQuery call from our static page to the API
* Tweak our local development process
* Add a new feature to our API and deploy it

## Introduction to V04
You now have a functioning website with both dynamic and static content being served through Cloudfront.  We have the
basic plumbing done and its time to start adding features.  First, we are going to add some Javascript to make sure
the server works correctly - but to make it work locally we'll have to tweak our development process.  Then we'll add 
another feature to the API (a chirp count) and work through how we deploy new versions of the API.

## Add a JQuery call from our static page to the API

So we now have an api endpoint that can tell us the current server time.  Lets add that to our index page using
JQuery.

Open up **index.html** in the static-site directory.  Find where it says 

    <h1>Chirp</h1> 

and under that add:

    <div>Server time: <span id="serverTime">TBD</span></div>

We are going to have JQuery replace that "TBD" with the current server time.  Open up **chirp.js** and find where
it says:

    console.log("Document ready placeholder");

You can delete that line, and in its place we will add this call:

    $.ajax({
        type: "GET",
        url: "/api/v1/info/server",
        contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        success: function (res, statusText, xhr, $form) {
            $("serverTime").html(res.serverTime);
        },
        error: function (res, statusText, xhr, $form) {
            $("serverTime").html("<h1>Error trying to lookup time: "+statusText+"</h1>");
        },
        dataType: 'json'
    });
